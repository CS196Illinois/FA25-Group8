CS 124 Honors AI Policy
For any AI generated code, you must:
1) Cite credits for code generated using AI in your comments
2) Fully understand the AI generated code that you are using


Rule of Thumb: Using AI-generated code without fully understanding how the code works is considered a violation of our AI policy.
In addition to the final presentation submission, each student will be required to submit a 7-10 minute Personal Code Walkthrough video. In this video, you should verbally explain the code that you personally wrote and describe any key implementation details. Your goal is to demonstrate that you understand exactly what your code does. More information about submission instructions and deadlines will be shared closer to the final presentation date.
Your PM may set additional guidelines regarding AI usage. Please consult your PM for specific guidelines.
Limited AI usage is encouraged
Why?
* It is being used in the industry and learning how to use it is an important skill. It enhances developer productivity if used correctly.
* LLMs should be used as a tool for development, not to code your entire project
* It is important to keep up with new tools and technologies since the world of AI is changing at a very rapid pace.
But.. proceed with caution!
AI must be used as a tool, not a replacement for your own thinking.
The overall consensus of the CS 124 Honors course staff is that extensive use of AI prevents you from actually building new skills and learning new frameworks and languages.


AI has a tendency of occasionally being confidently incorrect (hallucinations). You must always critically evaluate AI-generated suggestions before implementing them.


In other words, treat the LLM as a teammate, not a magic box. Always review generated code, understand it, and integrate yours intentionally.


If at any point you generate code using LLMs and you don’t understand the code, the CS 124 Honors course staff won’t be able to help you debug it.


It is easy to get stuck in a loop of generating buggy code which you don’t understand, and then using LLMs to debug it to produce more buggy code. We suggest you learn the fundamentals of the language that you are using for your project and whenever useful, take to sites like StackOverflow to debug. If at any point you get stuck in this cycle, take a step back (always commit different versions of your code locally) and try to break the functionality down to debug it.
